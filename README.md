# Do You Like This Song?
 ## Introduction 
This is a Machine Learning (ML) project predicting Spotify song likeness, whether a user will like or dislike a particular song in one of his Spotify playlists. Worked on the two datasets using ML models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and XGBoost, examining the precision of these algorithms in predicting whether a song will be liked or disliked by a user. 

## Predicting Songs: 
### Data 
The datasets are collections of song data from Spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify web API. It consists of 100 songs each from two Spotify playlists. I was able to access artist names, album names, track name, track ID and audio features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration of songs in milliseconds and time signature.
